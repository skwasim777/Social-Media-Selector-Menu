# Social Media Selector Menu
This is a simple web project that creates a dropdown-style social media selector menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can click on the "Social Media" menu, and a list of social media platforms with their respective icons and names will appear. They can then select a social media platform from the list, and the menu will display the chosen platform.





## Project Files
- 'index.html': This file contains the HTML structure of the project. It defines the layout, the menu, the list of social media platforms, and includes necessary links to external stylesheets and JavaScript files.

- 'style.css': The CSS file defines the styles for the project, including the menu's appearance, transitions, and the social media icons.

- 'index.js': The JavaScript file provides the interactivity for the project. It handles the toggling of the social media list when the menu is clicked and updates the selected platform's name when a social media item is clicked.


## Usage
1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to see the social media selector menu in action.

3. Click on the "Social Media" menu to reveal the list of social media platforms. You can click on any of the social media platform names to select it, and the selected platform's name will be displayed in the menu.
## Project Structure
HTML
- The HTML structure defines the menu container, social media list, and includes references to external CSS and JavaScript files.
CSS
- The CSS file contains styles for the menu and social media list, providing a visually appealing and interactive user interface.
JavaScript
- The JavaScript file adds functionality to the project. It handles the toggling of the social media list's visibility and updates the menu text when a social media platform is selected.

## Styling
The project uses a simple and modern design with a responsive layout. The menu and social media list have appropriate padding and spacing to ensure a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience.


## How It Works
1. Clicking the "Social Media" menu toggles the visibility of the social media list.

2. Clicking on a social media platform in the list updates the menu's text with the selected platform's name and hides the list.
